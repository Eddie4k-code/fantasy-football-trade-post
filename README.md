<h1 style="color:blue">Quick Description</h1>
<div>I created this website for a fantasy football leauge I am in. The issue we were having is we did not have a centralized place where every person in the leauge could post what there willing to trade away and what they would like to receive in return. </div>

<br></br>

<div>So, that is why I created this simple website where every person in the leauge can simply post to the form or look at the board and see who is willing to trade what. This idea definitley could be expanded much more however I created this as simple as possible for the users, it is just a simple form which then shows the output on the board.</div>
